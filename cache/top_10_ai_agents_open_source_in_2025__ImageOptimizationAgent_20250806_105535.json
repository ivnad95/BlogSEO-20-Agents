Showcase diverse AI agents (represented abstractly or through stylized icons) collaborating or performing tasks.  The scene should evoke intelligence, autonomy, and openness (open source).  Consider a grid-like structure with nodes representing agents and lines showing communication.  A subtle glow or vibrant color palette can emphasize the 'AI' aspect.",
