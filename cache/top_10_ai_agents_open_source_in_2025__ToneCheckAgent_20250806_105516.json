      "Reduce the level of enthusiasm in the introduction. Phrases like 'Forget expensive proprietary solutions' and 'Imagine personalized healthcare' are a bit too informal for a strictly professional tone.",
      "Replace less formal vocabulary with more precise and technical terms where appropriate. For example, instead of 'poised to reshape industries,' consider 'expected to significantly impact various sectors.'",
      "Ensure all claims about future impact are supported by data or evidence. While forward-looking statements are acceptable, they should be grounded in realistic projections.",
      "Maintain objectivity and avoid overly promotional language. Focus on the technical aspects and potential applications of the AI agents rather than hyping their revolutionary nature."
