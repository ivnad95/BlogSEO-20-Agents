    "content_gaps": [
      "Lack of forward-looking perspective: Most current articles focus on the present state of AI agents. A 2025 prediction requires extrapolation and informed speculation.",
      "In-depth technical evaluation: Many articles provide superficial overviews. A deeper dive into the architecture, capabilities, and limitations of specific open-source agents is missing.",
      "Focus on practical applications and use cases: Articles often lack concrete examples of how these agents can be applied in real-world scenarios and their impact on different industries in 2025.",
      "Emphasis on ethical considerations and potential risks: Discussions around the ethical implications, potential biases, and societal impact of increasingly autonomous AI agents are often overlooked.",
      "Comparative analysis across different agent types and frameworks: A comprehensive comparison of different open-source AI agent frameworks (e.g., AutoGen, Langchain Agent, AgentVerse) and their suitability for various tasks is rare."
